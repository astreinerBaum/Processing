Follow your own path
Be fearless in your pursuit 
Let love be the guide
Nature prevail 
Never by clock
Continually unfolding
Endless universe
swooping in on wings
to clothe all barren branches
spring to the rescue
The day narrated 
by imperfect grey 
and stray blue - 
the tired sky 
holding back the rain.
Stars streak  
Wishes made
Lightening clatter
Always feared
"He never loved you."
"No. He just loved differently."

first day of spring ~
budding branches bend 
with snow 
falling leaf
adds itself
to the pile
winter mist
bookmarking a moment
with this haiku
Second day of #Spring. I smile imagining the happy, fat, green #trees, but I'll also miss their brown, skinny‚Ä¶
Nature prevail 
Never by clock

Endless universe
Paper‚Äôs vanishing
like the trees we used for shade
before we could write.

words are going 
to sleep
Today,
he entered through
doors less frequently
opened. 
Dreamy fantasy
Brought down to earth everyday
Solid and unseen
pussywillows 
behind
the Court House 
the smart click
of high heels
through a haze
of leaflets
the ugliest 
gargoyle
ever
colours of new life
every heart yearning
peaceful restoration 
"Relax", he said;
slipped his fingers into
my laces.
And my heart sprinted.
in the tangled undergrowth
of the abandoned garden
a lone rose survives
to remind me
of you
Unsettling return.
Lime tree cafe. Afternoon.
Mirage of the past...
Looking at blossoms
Those of spring 
Awaking emotions
Magical connections
weighing
an envelope in my hand
the first raindrops  
when soul is 
full with optimism,
fears are out 
Naked limbs shiver
catching stars from twilight skies
reminders of snow
I slyly hid
my moans
in between the creases
of the sheets.
He had hell's fire
burning within him,
She was the snow queen
Mother Mary's child;
Together they were
heaven and hell.
mother is the 
evergreen spring
remembering one person
makes me miss them all
people I've lost.
Snow came
Winter froze
Life changed
Never died
remembering how you
entered a car butt first ...
where are you?
Cruelty oft times
Appears in the guise of a
Smile to disarm the
Unwary and to deceive
Itself that it is benign ¬©
I stand there feeling
The heat rush down my body
I love hot showers.
Don't batter me
with your lifestyle choices
Please do your own thing
but do it quietly
and I pledge
to view you oblivi‚Ä¶ 
Remembering moments 
Sharing love 
When spoken words  
Never declared 
"Detrus" is a word
that means "waste material".
You will not find it
in the dictionary.
Be compassionate
Share your smile with the whole world
Love all equally
Chorus of frogs
singing spring's hopeful music
new beginnings everywhere.
Jesus is a love song.‚ù§Ô∏èüôåüèæ

Et leurs pas

When it wasn‚Äôt 
Deception with
Rotten intention
leaves spinning 
in bicycle spokes 
she rode down country lanes
into star drenched skies
to read to the moon
Tsunami. 
deleting "p" 
from prose, 
having a 
catchy rose
The best explorers
learn to leave behind the bags
that will slow them down
Whenever..
A beautiful sky
sky turned grey
bring the washing in
enjoy the rain all day.
Let ink fill your page
Fill your heart with prose and verse
Smile with worded lips
Let us be like birds
Start the new day with a song
Yesterday is gone
worlds await
discovery
at my fingertips
News in print
over the years
truths n canards
more horrible than palatable
beget a menacing dragon
silent chat between
almond blossoms
and the sparrow
not easy to phrase
verses in nature
tease my tender hopes,
drive me to insanity,
Pandora's tale could not avert the growing curiosity.
Her mind is a mess,
and she has no intention 
on cleaning today. 
Night Owl
Je me contenterais
De miettes
De soleil
Dit la toute 
Petite √©toile
Perdue
Spring leaves unclench
pointing green fingers
at the sun.
silent chat between
almond blossoms
and the sparrow
not easy to phrase
verses in nature
In silent prayer, 
She cries and its no wonder,
We're left to ponder. 
Mental poetry
no headphones give you away
when in company
