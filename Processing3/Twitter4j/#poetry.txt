Nature prevail 
Never by clock
Continually unfolding
Endless universe
Spring has raised but a
Cold hand in greeting. I wish
She held warmer heart.
please
The government
Takes rights away
Unless you fight
To make them stay.
Of the woods
Of the sea
Of life
I wheeled with the stars,
my heart broke loose on the wind.
The simple words
with a tiny smile
& rainbows on the vesture
Claiming my share
of that unaccustomed gesture 
Follow your own path
Be fearless in your pursuit 
Let love be the guide
With thy young skiey blossoms heap me over 
why soul's dark night
when delicate luminosity
isn't so distant the ghosts
we dream soft-spoken
not silent flat-black day
Two hundred million
You lovely research vessel
Boaty McBoatface
What is this feeling?
It's the soaring joy of the
vernal equinox.
Sweet morning dove
Sang her morning song of hope
It seeped inside my heart
Nestling deep
Starry eyes of glitter
Forgetting to weep
An empire falls
From hate and greed,
Inflated fears,
And laws in weeds.
Moon takes centre stage
In a silent soliloquy
Casting its own spotlight
In a theatre
Festooned with stars
Life is one big road with lots of signs...
Unsettling return.
Lime tree cafe. Afternoon.
Mirage of the past...
Looking at blossoms
Those of spring 
Awaking emotions
Magical connections
